# Finger exercise: Write a program that examines three variablesâ€”x, y, and zâ€”and prints the largest odd number among them. If none of them are odd, it should print a message to that effect.

x,y,z = 23450,7,90
largest = 0
if x%2:
 largest = x
if y%2:
 if y > largest:
  largest = y
if z%2:
 if z > largest:
  largest = z
if largest:
 print ("largest odd number is", largest)
else:
 print ("there are no odd numbers")

 #this will print out "largest number is 7"
